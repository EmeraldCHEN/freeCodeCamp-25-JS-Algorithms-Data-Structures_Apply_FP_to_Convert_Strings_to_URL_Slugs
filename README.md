Many content management sites (CMS) have the titles of a post added to part of the URL for simple bookmarking purposes. 
For example, if you write a Medium post titled "Stop Using Reduce", it's likely the URL would have some form of the title string in it (".../stop-using-reduce").

This program declare the urlSlug function to convert a string title and return the hyphenated version for the URL using  useful array and string methods that follow functional programming principles.
